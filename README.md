# system_architecture
system design and architecture refer to the process of defining how a complex software or hardware system is structured and organized to meet specific requirements. 

overview:

### 1. **What is System Design?**
System design involves planning and defining the components, modules, interfaces, and data for a system to satisfy particular needs. It covers both high-level (architectural) and low-level (detailed component) design.

### 2. **Components of System Architecture**
- **Components/Modules:** Individual units with specific functions.
- **Data Flow:** How data moves between modules.
- **Interfaces:** How modules communicate.
- **Technologies:** The tools, programming languages, and frameworks used.
- **Deployment Environment:** Servers, cloud services, or hardware.

### 3. **Types of System Design**
- **High-Level Design (HLD):** Focuses on the overall system architecture, including modules, their interactions, data flow, and technology choices.
- **Low-Level Design (LLD):** Details each component's internal workings, algorithms, and data structures.

### 4. **Key Concepts in System Architecture**
- **Scalability:** Ability to handle growth in data or users.
- **Availability:** Ensuring the system is operational and accessible.
- **Reliability:** Systemâ€™s ability to function correctly over time.
- **Maintainability:** Ease of updates and fixes.
- **Security:** Protecting data and system assets.

### 5. **Common Architectural Patterns**
- **Monolithic:** All components in a single unit.
- **Microservices:** Decomposition into independent services.
- **Client-Server:** Separation between client and server.
- **Event-Driven:** Components communicate via events.
- **Layered Architecture:** Divides system into layers like presentation, business logic, data access.

### 6. **Design Process**
1. **Requirement Analysis:** Understand functional and non-functional needs.
2. **System Specification:** Define inputs, outputs, and constraints.
3. **High-Level Design:** Outline system modules and their interactions.
4. **Low-Level Design:** Detail individual components.
5. **Implementation Planning:** Decide on technologies and deployment strategies.
6. **Evaluation & Iteration:** Test and refine the design.

### 7. **Tools & Techniques**
- **UML Diagrams:** For visualizing architecture and workflows.
- **Flowcharts:** To represent process flow.
- **Data Modeling:** ER diagrams for database design.
- **Prototyping:** Build prototypes to validate design .
